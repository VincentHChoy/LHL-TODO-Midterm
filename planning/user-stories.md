## User stories:

1.	As a **user** I want to be able to create a **poll**, because I want to be able to decide what to do.
2.	As a user who creates the poll, I want to receive both submission (send to friends) and administrative links (access the results).
3.	As a user who creates the poll, I want to be able to see the results.
4.	As a user who creates a poll, I want to be able to receive a notification every time someone submits a poll.
5.	As a user who creates the poll, I should be able to submit to the poll.
6.	As a user who did not create the poll, I want to be able to rank my choices and submit my results.
7.	As a user who did not create a poll, I should not be able to see the result of a poll? Thoughts?
